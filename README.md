Virtual Galton Board

Welcome to the Virtual Galton Board project! This web application was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it allows users to interact with a virtual version of the famous Galton board.

What is a Galton Board?

A Galton board, also known as a quincunx, is a device that consists of a vertical board with a series of pegs or nails arranged in a triangular pattern. The board is filled with a large number of balls or beads, which are dropped from the top of the board. As the balls fall, they hit the pegs and bounce off in different directions, eventually landing in one of the bins at the bottom of the board. The Galton board is used to demonstrate the principles of statistical probability and the famous bell curve.

How to Use the Virtual Galton Board

The Virtual Galton Board allows users to drop virtual balls on the pegs and watch as they bounce and fall into different bins. Each bin represents a different mathematical function, and the cumulation of the bins will ultimately produce an exciting factual piece of trivia on the right side of the page. The application also allows users to keep track of high scores.

To use the Virtual Galton Board, simply open the application in your web browser and click on the "Drop Ball" button. You can drop as many balls as you want and watch as they fall into the bins. You can also view the high scores by clicking on the "High Scores" button.

Installation

To run the application, you will need to have a web browser installed on your computer. Simply open the index.html file in your browser to run the application.
